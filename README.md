# MemoryMarble
Welcome to Spoon's technical exercise created by Fran√ßois Corbel

How to test
  - [Download windows build](https://github.com/fcvalise/MemoryMarble/releases/download/v0.1/Build.zip)

How to inspect the project
  - Open the project with Unity 2021.3.2f1
  - Open scene located in Assets/2Hours/Scenes/MemoryMarble
  - Press play

How to interact (2hours version)
  1. Click on the UI Button to create memories
  2. When memories fade and start flying, click on them to inject light

How to interact (5hours version)
  1. Talk to the creature to create memories
  2. Say the words again to recall memories

  The original idea (next steps) is roughly prototyped in the 5 hours version.
  I'm aware it's out of the scope of your exercise because there's a creature and it took me about 5 hours.
  Unfortunatly, the pluggins I used for speech reocognition and face tracking seems to lack consistency.
